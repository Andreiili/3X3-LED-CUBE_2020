# 3X3-LED-CUBE_2020
## Objective
Implemented a 3x3 led cube's controlled trough shift registers

## Description

For every shift register exist an array with every value that should take and will be atributed to data and then forwarded to the shift register through the shiftout function for each shift register in particular.

Arduino has declared a shift-out function, but I preferred to make it from scratch to understand the way it is sent
